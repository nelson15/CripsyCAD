# CrispyCAD

 **Creators: ** Lucas Calvert, Corey Nelson

### Usage
Open the Xcode Project in Xcode, click the "Run" button

##### NOTE:
Unfortunately, Apple has decided to officially deprecate openGL (the primary graphics display used in this application) in their latest release of macOS. This means that CrispyCAD may currently be nonfunctional.
